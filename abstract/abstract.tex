The subjects of Universidade Federal Fluminense courses have information in several distinct Learning Management Systems. Thus the task of managing the content provided by the professors can become quite cumbersome.

In order to reduce the manual work done by the students, we proposed to create an application that allows aggregating information from various subjects and systems in a single user interface, regardless of where it was made available by the professors.

To accomplish this , we developed a multi -platform mobile application that aims to bring together in a single tool , multiple learning environments , presenting transparently to the user the services offered by different educational environments, such as events , topics, files , messages , all in a single interface.

The use of the application aims to bring together students and professors from various subjects taught at the university, intensify the interaction between classes, centralize the information and materials of the course and provide a fast and efficient communication. \\

Keywords: Learning Management System, Mobile Application, Ionic, Design Patterns, Phonegap, Ruby on Rails.
