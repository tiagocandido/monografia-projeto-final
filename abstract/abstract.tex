\thispagestyle{myheadings}

This part is destined to the abstract of your monograph. It must be written in the vernacular language and in an idiom of great popularization (English, French, Spanish, for example). This part should be done at last, because just after finishing the work it will be possible an overall understanding of the same. The abstract should not bring any further information, it is just the summary of the relevants aspects of the monograph, such as work gender, finality, methodology, results and conclusions. It must be written impersonally, to possess an extension from 150 to 500 words typed in simple space and in only one paragraph. It must be followed by the keywords of your monograph.\\

Keywords: Monograph. LaTeX. Hints.
